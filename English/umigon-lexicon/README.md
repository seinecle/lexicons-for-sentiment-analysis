# umigon-lexicon
⚠️ Terms in these lexicons are not supposed to be associated deterministically with a valence: they come with conditions and conditional expressions which appraise the context of use to identify the valence "at run time". Please use and evaluate umigon-lexicon with this important fact in mind.
